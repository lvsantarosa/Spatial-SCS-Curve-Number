# Spatial SCS Curve Number

The first step to applying the SCS method stat with the Curve Number (CN) calculation, in this example I used the land cover classification of the MamBiomas project (https://mapbiomas.org/) and map soil texture from Agronomical Institute o Campina (IAC) to the São Paulo State area to produce a spatial CN using the terra package.

The complete SCS Methodis disponible in the documents of USDA https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1044171.pdf
